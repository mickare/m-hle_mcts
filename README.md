# Nine man's morris with Monte-Carlo Tree Search players

This project is a small hands-on learning project of mine. The goal is to try programming MCTS and get a better
understanding of underlying challenges and algorithms. Be warned, the code is very hacky & ugly to see.
It is more than an experimental prototype and learning project than a usefull project.

### Usage
Simply run `demo.py`. Both MCTS players should now start battling. :smiley:

### ToDo
- Improve Performance of game and simulation
- Until now it is a naive approach to MCTS. There are many improvements to be done and to be experimented on...
- Research more MCTS
- In future maybe add a GUI, instead of printing to the terminal.
